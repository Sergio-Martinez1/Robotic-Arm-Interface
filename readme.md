# Robotic Arm Interface

This was a project for a university subject, it consisted to 
build a robotic arm using printed 3d pieces, a microcontroller 
and servomotors for the joints.

The robotic arm needed to connect to a software interface that
communicated with the microcontroller, in this case i designed a new
one in C#, the design was taken from another project, but all the 
functionalities and programming behind was made by me.

The software interface was thought to make programming instructions for 
the robotic arm to simulate a task to do (lift objects for example), 
also the interface could save a document with the intructions and could 
import them. The interface also allowed you to control all the joints via 
ui sliders and also can run the programming instruccions in step by
step or the whole program at once.
